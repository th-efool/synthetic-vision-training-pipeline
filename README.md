# Training a Large Model Using Unity Perception Images

## 🧠 Abstract
This project investigates how a large state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, **YOLOv8**, performs when trained and fine-tuned using **synthetic images generated by Unity Perception** and **real-world datasets**.  
Some object classes are underrepresented in real datasets, which leads to poor model generalization.  
To address this imbalance, we use **Unity’s Perception package** to generate 3D synthetic images of these rare or missing objects under varied lighting, camera angles, and backgrounds.  
The resulting images and annotations are then used to **augment real datasets** and evaluate performance improvements in object detection tasks.

Our goal is to demonstrate that combining Unity-generated synthetic data with real data can significantly enhance model robustness and accuracy on underrepresented classes.

## ⚙️ Framework and Tools

- **Framework:** [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** [Unity Perception Package](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.perception)
- **Real Dataset Source:** [COCO 2017](https://cocodataset.org/#download) subset from Kaggle (cup, bottle, chair, laptop, book classes)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Some object categories in large datasets are severely underrepresented, making it difficult for deep learning models to learn their features effectively.  
This project explores the impact of **synthetic data augmentation** — generated using Unity’s 3D environment — on training performance and accuracy when compared with purely real-world data.

## 📊 Dataset Description

| Dataset | Source | Description | Size |
|----------|---------|-------------|------|
| **Real Dataset** | [COCO 2017 (subset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/coco-dataset/coco-2017) | Contains real images of cups, bottles, chairs, laptops, and books. Used as baseline training data. | ~250 images |
| **Synthetic Dataset** | Generated with Unity Perception | Contains rendered 3D scenes of the same objects under various lighting, camera angles, and backgrounds. | ~250 images |

Each label file corresponds to an image and follows YOLO format:  
`class_id x_center y_center width height`
