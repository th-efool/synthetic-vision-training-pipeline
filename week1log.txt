Week 1 Progress Log

Project Title: Training a Large Model Using Unity Perception Images

Date: November 3, 2025- November 9 2025

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Objective for the Week:
   - Understand the main problem of dataset imbalance in object detection tasks.
   - Set up Unity Perception to generate synthetic images for underrepresented object classes.
   - Review suitable real-world datasets to combine with synthetic data.

2. Activities Completed:
   - Installed Unity Hub and Unity Editor with Perception package.
   - Created a sample 3D scene with labeled objects using Unity Perception.
   - Exported a small set (≈100 images) of synthetic labeled images for testing.
   - Researched real-world datasets on Kaggle; shortlisted:
       • COCO 2017 dataset (for general object detection)
       • Pascal VOC 2012 dataset (for validation)
   - Installed YOLOv8 and tested model training using a small sample dataset.

3. Issues/Challenges:
   - Large Unity-generated datasets require high storage and GPU resources.
   - Label formats differ between Unity Perception (JSON) and YOLOv8 (TXT/YOLO format).

4. Next Steps:
   - Convert Unity-generated JSON labels to YOLO-compatible format.
   - Prepare combined dataset (synthetic + real) for training.
   - Start fine-tuning YOLOv8 model on combined dataset.
   - Evaluate results and record metrics for baseline performance.

Summary:
This week focused on dataset preparation and environment setup. The project direction is clear — the next week will emphasize data conversion and training pipeline implementation.
