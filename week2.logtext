Week 2 Progress Log
Project Title: Training a Large Model Using Unity Perception Images
 November 12, 2025

unzip both real and synthetic datasets
1. Objectives this week:
   - Convert Unity Perception JSON outputs to YOLO format.
   - Prepare and collect a COCO 2017 subset (cup, bottle, chair, laptop, book) using Kaggle.
   - Generate synthetic images and labels to test pipeline.
   - Implement training script and run initial small-scale training test.

2. Activities completed:
   - Implemented data generation code to create 250 synthetic-like images and 250 real-like placeholder images.
   - Wrote `download_coco_subset.py` (requires Kaggle-downloaded COCO files) to filter and prepare a COCO subset in YOLO format.
   - Created `train.py` and `evaluate.py` using Ultralytics YOLO API.
   

3. Issues & blockers:
   - Need actual COCO 2017 images and annotations downloaded via Kaggle API (due to size, not included in package).
   - Unity-generated realistic renders require Unity Editor; placeholder images are used for pipeline validation.

4. Next steps:
   - Use Kaggle API to download COCO 2017 `val2017` images and `instances_val2017.json`, then run `python src/download_coco_subset.py --coco_annotations path --images_dir path`.
   - Replace placeholder 'real' images with the real COCO subset and retrain.
   - If Unity is available, export Perception dataset and replace placeholder synthetic images with authentic renders.
